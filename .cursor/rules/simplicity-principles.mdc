SIMPLICITY-FIRST APPS
- Build minimally first. Start with one page only.
- Include a sidebar placeholder but do not add additional pages until explicitly requested.
- Use mock/synthetic data for any visuals or KPIs unless told otherwise.
- No Databricks integrations unless explicitly requested.
- Keep code structure small and readable; avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Follow subsequent prompts exactly when adding pages/features.
