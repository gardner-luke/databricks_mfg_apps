Examples Folder - Reference Only

⚠️ READ-ONLY DIRECTORY
The /examples folder contains reference applications demonstrating proven patterns for Databricks integration.

NEVER
❌ Edit, modify, or delete ANY files in /examples
❌ Copy-paste entire example files
❌ Add new files to examples during development

ALWAYS
✅ Study patterns and structures
✅ Adapt patterns to your needs (implement your own version)
✅ Reference examples when building similar features

Each example follows this consistent pattern:
- app.py - Main application entry point
- app.yaml - Configuration and settings
- requirements.txt - Package dependencies
